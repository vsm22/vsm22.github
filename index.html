                <p>
                This is an in-progress project.
                </p>

                <p>
                GN-Launchpad is a host and configuration platform for the Novation Launchpad written in TypeScript with JavaScript compilation target. 
                The goal of the project is to create a JSON-configurable host that allows users to quickly and with great flexibility configure the 
                behavior of their Launchpad for custom applications within any MIDI environment. The design follows a JSON-configurable “batteries included, 
                but removable” approach, which provides sensible defaults, but also allows quick and extensible configuration. Current MIDI host environment 
                targets include Cycling74 Max and Chrome, while theoretically any MIDI-capable JavaScript environment is possible. 
                </p>

                <p>
                The idea is to be able to configure the launchpad behavior with a simple JSON configuration like below.
                The below configuration means toggle one button on and off, but only one per row.

                <p>
                The purpose of this project was to provide a zero-dependency library of SVG-based UI widgets that could be used for building
                audio applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                The development of the project addressed three areas of concern:
                how to structure the code base and class design to facilitate long-term development; 
                how to structure state management for consistent behavior and easy-to-implement feature changes; 
                how to structure the audio modules to facilitate behavior sharing, confinement of responsibilities, and flexibility in an audio application architecture.
                </p>

                <p>
                The codebase is structured around abstract base classes which implement the core functionality, state management, and initialization, and additional functionality is provided by mixins. Each specific class is required to conform to the contract specified by the base class. This codebase structure allows for robust long-term development, ensuring that each new implemented module relies on a solid base of core functionality, and is concerned only with implementing the specific behavior required by the module.
                State management is implemented using a single-source-of-truth approach where component state is stored in the simplest possible representation and propagated throughout the component on each state change. This design allows for predictable behavior, business logic that is easy to reason about, and confinement of behavior so that feature changes may be trivially implemented without breaking the component.

                    This is a simple-as-pie bash tool. It watches a directory for changes and copies changes to a second directory with
                    arbitrary ownership and priviliges that you set. This is useful if you want to, for exmaple, work on a project as 
                    one user, and have it served by a server that is running as a different user when the server needs to be able to 
                    modify files in the project.

                <a href="https://cycling74.com/" target="_blank">Max</a> is my go-to tool for building anything audio-related.
                Besides its own rich collection of objects, it allows integrating JavaScript, Java, Python, as well as compiling 
                Max objects from C or C++. I've recently started to be more organized about maintaining tools I build for 
                max and putting them in this repo.

                A generative instrument built in Max that I used for part of my dissertation at Duke. 
                It generates rhythm based on a probability histogram, generates notes based on a 'kernel'
                and 'offset' definition, and manipulates samples by rhythmic granular splicing.

                When I worked with Slippage, one of our tasks was to create an installation for John Hope Franklin's centennial celebration
                at the Nasher Museum. The installation would resemble a photo-booth, where instead of taking photos, visitors would record
                their testimonies regarding the influence of John Hope Franklin's work on them. There were some distinguished guests, including
                the activist Angela Davis. The 'photo-booth' would integrate the testimonies in real-time into a video collage playing
                on the outside, interspersed with John Franklin's own interviews. I used Max and JavaScript for the project, with Max's Jitter
                components handling the video processing, and JavaScript to provide the master controller that links the different elements.
